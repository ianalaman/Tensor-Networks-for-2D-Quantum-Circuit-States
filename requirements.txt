# Scientific Computing & Tensor Operations (for classical contraction)
numpy>=1.24.0       # Essential for matrix operations (MPS/MPO tensors)
scipy>=1.10.0       # For sparse linear algebra and optimization routines
# or alternatively: quimb (excellent for 2D tensor networks/PEPS)

# Visualization & Notebooks
matplotlib          # For plotting accuracy vs bond dimension
jupyter             # For running the .ipynb notebooks
