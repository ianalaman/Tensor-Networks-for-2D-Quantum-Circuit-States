Project Overview
This repository houses the code and documentation for investigating a restricted subclass of Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) generated by applying a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) to a Matrix Product State (MPS).

The primary goal is to examine this MPS-MPO construction as a practical representation for translationally invariant 2D Hamiltonians, identifying trade-offs between expressiveness and computational tractability. The project includes both classical numerical implementations and sequential quantum circuit realizations.
